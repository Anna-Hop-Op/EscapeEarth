# Activity-1: Cheers and Challenges Function


__Instructions:__ We will split into two breakout rooms and write
a function that will randomly select our group's representative
at Tuesdays' large group cheers & challenges. 

Hints: 
- using a for loop will be helpful. also check out
- [numpy.random.randint](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.randint.html) to generate a random integer.
- remember to make a list with all of our names to serve as our "data".
