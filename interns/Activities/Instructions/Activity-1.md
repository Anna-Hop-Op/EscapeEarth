# Activity-1: Cheers and Challenges Function


__Instructions:__ We will split into two breakout rooms and write
a function that will randomly select our group's representative
at Tuesdays' large group cheers & challenges. One person should share 
their screen showing their google colab notebook as you live code
together - if you are not sharing your screen you must tell the sharer
what to type. Everyone should have a copy of the final function in 
their notebooks. Everyone is welcome to test things within their own 
notebooks. 

Hints: 
- using a for loop will be helpful. 
- also check out [numpy.random.randint](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.randint.html) to generate a random integer.
- remember to make a list with all of our names to serve as our "data".
